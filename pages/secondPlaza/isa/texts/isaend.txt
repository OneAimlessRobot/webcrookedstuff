With Isa's end now finally established, We then slowly fade out of the scene in heaven. Fading in, is a scene of a black background, with only and still a young Isa visibile to us, that was still in her grandparents' house  dancing with her arms open and spinning ocasionally. In periods of 60 seconds, she grows her lungs, breathing in slowly and then exhaling as she does a 360, just to go back to troting casually. As background sound plays a soft breakcore, with soft rock elements, high in pace, low in violence. It sounds eerly melancholic, yet hopeful. It sounds cheerful. Scourge from Yakui the Maid. It sounds... calm. Resigned yet accepting.
