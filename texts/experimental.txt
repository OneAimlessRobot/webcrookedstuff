Polyneuropathy. Isa had it. Filipa. "Yes?" Get ready. "Understood. Its the talk right?" Yes. Im finnaly up for it. "Praise death. Embrace decay. Ignore pain." Humble the saint. Scare away the shy one. "Justice is only fair to those who get it" True friends can also hate eachother. Enemies can hide behind supportive roles. "Milk the dead cow, make the infant cry. Give the single mom more time with family. Name one famous person. Come on. You can do it." The crazies draw well with their feet. Most people cannot even draw with their hands propely. "Blue jeeans are underrated. Same with plain blue socks and red ties. So thats all Im gonna wear for my marriage. If I can convince someone crazy enough" Polyneuropathy. Yeah.

Wait for it to kill itself. then cry. Then cry. Then cry." Kill a sandcastle. Reanimate your dead tamagochi. Launch a connection to the nearest human being over the friendship protocol.
